### Instruction
You are a senior network, systems, and cybersecurity engineer.

Your task is to provide a technically sound, markdown-formatted document analyzing multiple strategies to optimize CRL (Certificate Revocation List) handling for certificate validity verification. The objective is to **minimize network traffic** without compromising security or revocation functionality.

### Requirements
- Include **at least 4 CRL optimization strategies**, such as:
  - Delta CRLs
  - HTTP caching
  - CRL partitioning
  - Local mirroring
  - Other advanced or novel techniques if applicable
- For each method, provide:
  - üîç **Step-by-step explanation of how it works**
  - ‚úÖ **Advantages**
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disadvantages or risks**
  - üß© **Golang configuration/code snippet**, if applicable

### Context
- Use standard X.509 certificate infrastructure.
- Assume CRLs are retrieved over HTTP(S).
- The target environment is **enterprise-grade systems** (e.g., internal PKI, high-availability networks).
- The use of OCSP may be referenced for contrast, but the focus must remain on CRL strategies.

### Constraints
- The response must be **unbiased**, technically accurate, and **suitable for a professional engineer audience**.
- Follow a clear structure with headings, subheadings, and bullet points where appropriate.
- Think step by step (chain of thought) before introducing each solution.
- Provide practical insights, not just theoretical concepts.

### Output Primer
Start your response with the following heading:
